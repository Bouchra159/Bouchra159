Water supply is the provision of water by public utilities, commercial organizations, community endeavors, or by individuals.

Water supply system is a network of infrastructure designed to provide treated water to consumers.

Energy use for water supply depends on the treatment process, transportation, and distribution.

The energy used for water supply includes treatment, transportation, and distribution of water.
Energy use for water supply can be calculated by measuring the energy consumed during treatment, transportation, and distribution.

Neural networks can be used to analyze and model water supply data for prediction and optimization.
The water-energy nexus presents challenges for water supply due to the high energy consumption of water treatment and distribution.
The water-energy nexus impacts water supply by increasing energy consumption and costs, which can lead to environmental and economic problems.
